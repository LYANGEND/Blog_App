# Rails Blog

> The Rails blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I created a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

- Run git clone on this project at the desired directory:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Mo7amedSMahdi/rails-blog.git
  ```
- Go to the cloned directory with `cd rails-blog`
- Install the required dependecies with `bundle install`
- Install npm dependencies with `npm install`
- With Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL installed in your environment, you can run `rails s` to see the website

## Tests

- To run the tests you must first have run `bundle install`
- Then in the repository's main directory run `bundle exec rspec spec`
